# About-Mokshya-Protocol
Moskhya is an open-source protocol building smart contacts and SDKs for Aptos Blockchain. Our objective is to help onboard the next 10,000+ web3 projects by building well documented smart contracts and SDKs for developers.

We're a group of like-minded devs and project managers building open-source and innovative solutions for multiple blockchains. Mokshya is a Sanskrit term that means liberation from the cycle of death and rebirth. Our aim at Mokshya is to liberate and empower developers.
